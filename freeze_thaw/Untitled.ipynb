    "#### Introduction\\n\",\n",
    "    \"I am considering the numerical problem which approximates the dispersion of a passive pollutant in a groundwater flow field via diffusive and advective processes, all other processes left out of consideration. 'Passive pollutant' in this contexts refers to a pollutant which does not affect the flow field in which it is dispersed, and so interacts with the problem in a passive sense. Numerical methods to model groundwater flow are key to understanding one of our most important resources (i.e. freshwater) and provide insight into how to manage and protect vital watersheds. Numerical models can, for example, give us insight into the how changes in precipitation may affect groundwater drinking sources for communities, or how a leak or spill of contaminants will be absorbed and travel within an aquifer. The problem that I have chosen to investigate physically resembles the problem of how a passive pollutant is transported in a simple time and space invariant flow field via advective and diffusive processes.\\n\",\n",

We can also define a velocity field $\\\\vec{velocity} = (u,v)$. Working from left to right, each term represents accumulation, diffusion in $x, y$ down-gradient from high to low concentrations, and advection in $x, y$ along the flow field, respectively. \\n\",\n",

Without a handrail for where the model behaves in a stable way, I've used a relatively coarse spatial grid in comparison with my timestep. My understanding is that the timestep has an upper limit which is dependent on the spatial step, diffusivity, and velocity field, but I was unable to derive that relationship. \\n\",\n",
